Please feel free to use this calander template to create a quick 9-5 daily schedule to orginize your day! Use the inpage clock to track the time of the day. You'll see as well that as time passes, the middle portion will switch colors, this will either indicate that you are past that time, in that current time. Or not at that time yet!

Directions below:
1. On the left hand side, it shows what time of the day it is.
2. Enter in text in the green areas for your tasks.
3. On the right hand side is your save button to save your tasks!
4. Once the new day starts and you want to reuse the calander please feel free to clear it by clicking on the "clear calander" button!

Credits. 
As always our boot camp module is a great deal of help -https://umn.bootcampcontent.com/University-of-Minnesota-Boot-Camp/UofM-VIRT-BO-FSF-PT-04-2022-U-B

W3schools(https://www.w3schools.com/) has been a key part in helping me understand what syntax works best and how it works in my Script.
